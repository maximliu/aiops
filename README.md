# Science of AIOPS 

Welcome to the **Science of AIOPS** blog! 

This is a github repository where ideas and technical articiles on AIOPS are published, discussed and analyzed. I welcome all sort of contributions in terms of articiles and code to this exciting topic.

Content of this blog mainly covers following areas of AIOPS:

- Core algorithms for supporting intelligent management.
	* Causal Inference
	* Time Series Analysis
	* DNN
	* Boosting/Bagging/Ensembles
	* Meta Learning
	* Model Transfer
	* Feature Analysis
- Novel use cases of AIOPS.
- Theory and science of AIOPS.

* [Novelty Detection](articiles/novelty.md)
* [Algorithms for Chang Point Detection](articiles/cp.md)


> [Bio] I am a researh scientist working in areas of intelligent management of future networks and communication infrastructures. My growing interests on AI support operations motivates me to create this blog and write articles on the fundamental technologies & sciences as well as personal thoughts on this very topic. Also I am looking forward for collaborations with colleagues and folks who have strong interests in this challenging yet highly important topics. I could be contacted under maximliu(at)gmail.com.
